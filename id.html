									<h2>Fingerprint Scanners and IDs</h2>
									<span class="byline">
										
									</span>
								</header>
								<img src="images/id-large.jpg" alt="" />
								<p>The Campus Card (variously known as the ID Card, University ID, or Student ID) can serve as: an identification card; an electronic key card controlling access to residence and dining halls, libraries, recreational facilities, and staff office buildings; and a debit card which can be used to purchase goods and services at select locations on campus.</p>
<p><h3>Features</h3></p>
<p>Cardinal Money (prepaid dining money can be used only at Residential & Dining Enterprises (R&DE) dining locations, and some retail locations). Cardinal Money can be purchased online by students (and their parents), faculty, and staff.</p>
<p>The CardPlan could allow students to pay for goods and services on campus, including the Bookstores and other retail locations. The CardPlan for faculty and staff can be a copy- and print-only debit plan.</p>
<p><h3>Access to Campus Facilities and Services</h3></p>
<p>The primary use of the ID Card is to verify a cardholder's status as a member of the College community. To enter certain campus facilities-the various fitness centers, for example-one merely must show his or her Card. But increasingly, to gain access to other campus facilities and services, an individual must present his card, which is then "read" by an electronic scanner that verifies that the cardholder is eligible to use that facility or service. This system helps the University to ensure that the use of campus facilities and services is limited to eligible members of the Stanford community. It is expected that the number of campus facilities and services whose access requires the electronic scanning of the ID Card will increase in the future.</p>
<p>The information that is electronically recorded when an individual attempts to gain access to a campus facility or service is fairly innocuous. When the electronic scanners read an individual's card, they merely indicate whether or not the cardholder's status at the University makes her eligible to use that particular facility or service. The Campus Card System electronically records that at a certain time, the card belonging to a particular cardholder was read by that particular scanner, and whether access to that facility or service was permitted or denied.</p>
<p><h3>Student Meal Card</h3></p>
<p>The second widespread use of the ID Card is as a student's meal card. The Campus Card system electronically stores information about the meal plan to which a student subscribes. When the student goes through the food line in one of the dining halls managed by the University his card is scanned. The record notes that at a particular time a certain scanner number read the card of a particular student and deducts one meal from that student's meal count for the week. The record does not indicate any additional or more specific information, such as what or how much food the student consumed during the meal.</p>
<p><h3>Maintenance and protection of Campus Card electronic records</h3></p>
<p>The Campus Card System is a closed, proprietary system that runs on its own hardware and software. The hardware for the system is housed on campus, and direct access to the system is generally limited to the Manager of the Campus Card Services. </p>
<p>The Campus Card System is completely separate from the student Axess system, which includes a student's grades, academic history, and tuition paid. The Card system receives students' registration status from the Registry, which is fed from Axess, and meal-plan status, which is fed from NSI just as it receives the current employment status of faculty and staff from the Persona system. These systems do not feed any other information, such as the cost of a student's meal plan or a staff member's salary, into the Campus Card system.</p>
<p>Every electronic ID Card transaction is recorded and remains on the active Campus Card System for one month. After a month, the records are transferred to optical disks, which are stored on campus. At the present time, the optical disks are kept indefinitely and are not destroyed, erased, or copied. In addition, the Campus Card System is backed up on optical disks each day, to ensure that the database can be restored in the event of a system failure. The backup disks are kept for seven days, after which they are reused. The data on both the disks containing the monthly records and the backup disks are stored in a proprietary format that can be read only by the Campus Card System software. As a result, the information on the disks is extremely secure, as only IT Services can retrieve data off the disks.</p>
<p><h3>Types</h3></p>
<p>USB-based Card Readers for use with computers:</p>
<p>Pricing: ~$85.00 - $100.00 per unit</p>
<p>Uses: collecting card swipes at fixed locations or offices with easy access to power and a computer</p>
<p>Pros: cost effective, standardized</p>
<p>Cons: limited mobility, requires attachment to computer via USB</p>
<p>Wireless Card Readers for use with computers</p>
<p>Pricing: ~$200.00 - $400.00 per unit</p>
<p>Uses: collecting card swipes at locations without power or with various points of entry</p>
<p>Pros: greater mobility and ease of use</p>
<p>Cons: easier to lose, data may have to be downloaded from device for upload into College Database</p>
<p>Handheld Card Readers for use with mobile devices</p>
<p>Pricing: ~$700.00 - $1,000.00 per unit</p>
<p>Uses: collecting card swipes at locations without power or with various points of entry utilizing touch/tablet devices</p>
<p>Pros: greater mobility, ease of use, and compatible with a common resource found on campus (e.g., Apple devices)</p>
<p>Cons: high cost, multiple pieces of hardware, may require download of an additional app</p>
<p><h3>Data Collection</h3></p>
<p>Using your selected card reader collect the unique ID information contained on your campus cards.  For simplicity and ease of use it is important to only collect 1 unique ID number per person who is attending. There are two options for collecting this information:</p>
<p>1.	In real-time using CollegiateLink swipe interface</p>
<p>2.	By collecting the data into a .csv file that can then be uploaded into CollegiateLink via the "Track Attendance" section the event information. Upon upload the attendance data will be associated with the correct user information.</p>
